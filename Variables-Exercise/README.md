## Exercise 1:
### Step 1:

Declare and initialize variables for the following types:

- string
- int
- char
- bool
- double
- decimal

### Step 2:
Interpolate these variables in a Console.Writeline();

For example:
```
string dogName = "Ralph";
int dogAge = 10;	

Console.WriteLine($"My dog's name is {dogName}, He is {dogAge} years old");
```

### Step 3:
Analyze any errors you might incur, if any, and research how to fix it. This is a prime opportunity to exemplify self-learning.
Once finished, save, commit, and push back to Github
